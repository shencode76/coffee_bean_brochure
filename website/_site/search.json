After being picked, coffee seeds need to go through a series of processes to become the coffee we drink.\n                \n            \n             \n                 \n                    Processing Step 2：Fermentation\n                    After the flesh is removed, the beans undergo a fermentation process. Fermentation helps to remove pulp residue and improve flavor.\n                \n            \n    \n            \n                \n                    \n                    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n                \n    \n                 \n                    Processing Step 3：Baking\n                    During the roasting process, the water is evaporated and the flavor of the beans is further enhanced. The roasting time and temperature of each coffee bean is different, which determines its taste.\n                    Video reference: Pinterest\n                \n            \n    \n    \n            \n                \n                    \n                    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n                \n                \n                    Processing Step 4：Grinding\n                    After roasting, the beans need to be ground into powder, which is used to brew coffee or make food products such as coffee cakes.\n                    Video reference: Pinterest\n                \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n   \n        🌍 Where do Arabica and Robusta grow?\n    \n        Here we explore where the world’s best Arabica and Robusta coffee beans are grown. The rankings are based on the average cup scores that countries have earned across different harvest years.  \n    \n        \n            Begin by selecting a top country like Ethiopia from the bar chart. \n            Follow its cup score trends in the scatter plot to see how quality is maintained over time. \n            Then, hover over the map to uncover high-altitude regions, where cooler climates and rich soils create exceptional beans. \n        \n        \n        By comparing different countries, you can discover how geography, climate, and farming traditions influence the flavors we love.\n        \n    \n        \n        🌟 What is the Cup Score?\n        \n            The Cup Score is how coffee earns its reputation.  \n            Rated out of 100, it measures aroma, flavor, acidity, and body.  \n            A score above 80 means the coffee is “specialty grade” — rare, rich, and crafted to perfection.\n        \n        \n    \n        Select Coffee Type:  Arabica Robusta \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n         \n    \n           \n        Arabica beans show higher and more consistent average cup scores across countries and time, with top performers like United State(Hawaii) and Ethiopia. Robusta beans, while more geographically concentrated, generally have lower cup scores and greater variation across regions. The Coffee Belt highlights global growing zones for both types. \n \n    \n        💰 Does a high cupping score mean high exportation prices?\n    \n        The chart below illustrates the global dynamics and price distribution of coffee bean exports. We selected the three countries with the highest average cupping scores:\n    \n        \n            🥇 Thailand (84.51)\n            🥈 United States (84.33)\n            🥉 Lao PDR (83.77)\n        \n    \n        \n        For each country, we focus on its top 10 export destinations, which typically account for over 70% of its total coffee exports.\n        Click on a country name—Thailand, the United States, or Lao PDR—to reveal its top 10 export destinations.\n        When hovered over, the bar charts below will show each destination’s trade value and unit price (USD/kg).\n        \n    \n        \n        Coffees from the United States and Thailand are consistently sold at higher average unit prices—\n        around 6.5 and 6.0 USD/kg, respectively—compared to Lao PDR’s 3.1 USD/kg, aligning with their higher cupping scores.\n        \n    \n        Notably:\n        \n        \n            The U.S. exports to Asian markets like Japan, Korea, and China at especially high prices, often above 7 USD/kg, \n            while sales to Western countries like Canada and Germany are lower.\n        \n        \n            Thailand’s export prices fall in a moderate range of 5.3–6.9 USD/kg.\n        \n        \n            Lao PDR’s prices remain very stable across destinations, mostly within 2.9–3.3 USD/kg.\n        \n        \n       \n\n        \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n\n    \n \n        \n            \n        \n    \n        \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Through this journey, from the farm to the global market and into everyday conversations, we hope you now see that coffee is not just a drink, but a story shaped by nature, craftsmanship, and the passions of people all around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n  ↑"
